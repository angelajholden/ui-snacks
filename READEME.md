These are simple UI snacks built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal of these snippets are to demonstrate accessible, modern code, and make it easy for anyone to learn from.

_This project is free and open source, and focused on helping new frontend developers practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript with realworld examples._
